## Use Case (UC): Running default config on the JUAMI Potentiostat for Alpha release.
Intended User: Graduate student (GS) familiar with dev team and basic electrochemistry concepts. The instructions in this UC assume that the student has a resistor they can attach clips to.
Assumes little to no knowledge of python. Assumes access to a Windows computer.

### Before Installation: 
1. Member of dev team gives GS a JUAMI Potentiostat with a 1kOhm resistor.
1. GS installs python on their computer.

### Installation:
1. GS recieves email from member of dev team with link to release page.
1. GS follow instructions on release page to install pytentiostat program.

### Experimental Setup:
1. GS plugs the USB cable into the computer and the potentiostat.
1. GS attaches alligator clips to the resistor; one side with the working electrode and the other side with counter and reference electrodes.

### Program Setup:
1. GS copies the default example config file to an easy to navigate to directory (WD).
1. GS opens up a console window.
1. GS navigates to the WD.
1. GS types command pytentiostat.

### Pytentiostat Operation:
1. Pytentiostat prints to console "Welcome to the JUAMI pytentiostat interface!".
1. Pyentiostat prompts "Press enter to connect to a JUAMI potentiostat.".
1. GS presses enter.
1. Pytentiostat prints to console "Searching for potentiostat...".
1. Pyentiostat prints to console "Pytentiostat connected COM. Reading configuration file...".
1. Pytentiostat prints to console "Press enter to load the config file".
1. GS presses enter.
1. Pytentiostat prints to console "Press enter to start the experiment".
1. Pytentiostat runs experiment in config.
1. Pyentiostat displays plot of real-time data to user.
1. After running experiment, pytentiostat promopts "Would you like to save the data? [y/n]".
1. GS types y.
1. Pytentiostat saves the data to their desktop.
1. Pytentiostat prompts if user wants to run another experiment.
1. GS types n.
1. Pytentiostat program closes.
